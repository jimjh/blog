    </div>
    <div id="article_text">
      <p>I spent the weekend at PennApps, a hackathon organized by undergraduate
students at UPenn. Quixey was the main sponsor, and it was a blast. I enjoyed
mentoring, and especially had a great time pretending to know a lot about
hardware :p</p>
<p>While working with various teams, I noticed a pattern: although I was not an
expert on many of the technologies they were working with, I was able to help
them accelerate their hacks just by focusing on some fundamental engineering
skills. Two of my teams won various prizes at PennApps, and I was beyond
satisfied.</p>
<h2>Learn to Use Git</h2>
<p>If you are a college student, you probably did not get much practice working in
teams on coding projects - PennApps X was a first for many of the students I
worked with at the hackathon. Recognizing the need for version control and
having a good understanding of the basics is a crucial for productive
collaboration. As a participant, you must learn how to commit code, merge
branches, resolve conflicts, and revert changes. This will allow you to divide
and conquer, experiment with new ideas, and try out various implementations
while keeping a safe checkpoint that you know how to revert to when things go
wrong.</p>
<p>If you find your self commenting out huge chunks of code and labeling them
“Attempt 1”, or “Working!”, stop and <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">learn Git</a>.</p>
<h2>Stop and Debug</h2>
<p>Hackathons are frustrating, because your code doesn’t work most of the time.
Yet, this is precisely the point - a hackathon is an intense period of learning
during which you experiment with new APIs, SDKs, frameworks, and even
languages. Expect problems and learn to fix them.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing your hands in the air and yelling, “it doesn’t work!” learn
to ask, “what is the error?” Rapidly narrow down the space of possible causes,
using binary search if you can. Insert print statements, set breakpoints (if
possible), and find error messages. Figure out how to reproduce the problem
quickly and reliably. Unless you have noisy input or random variables, your
code should behave deterministically. It is magic iff you don’t understand what
you wrote.</p>
<p>After the initial investigation, form a hypothesis about the cause and test it.
Comment out chunks of code selectively to isolate the cause.</p>
<p>(As a mentor, I usually think aloud as I work on debugging the problem to show
them how to determine the cause of a problem and create a fix.)</p>
<h2>Use Google (Intelligently)</h2>
<p>You get stuck. A lot. Google is your friend, but sometimes it’s hard,
especially if you don’t know what you are looking for.</p>
<p>Start by figuring out specifically what you need to learn. What function do you
need? What could it be called? If you were the engineer who built on the
library/API/SDK, how would you implement it? Where would you put it?</p>
<p>Start searching on Google. Speed read though the first few results to determine
their relevance. Use related content to guess and discover keywords until you
close in on what you need.</p>
<p>Finally, form hypotheses from what you have learnt, and test these hypotheses.
If necessary, validate your learning using tiny examples before trying to work
it into your current project.</p>
<p><em>If you are participating in an upcoming hackathon, practice these skills before
the hackathon and get a 8 to 12-hour productivity edge.</em></p>
